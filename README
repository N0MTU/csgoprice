This is a small python project employing:
Web crawlers from the BeautifulSoup lib
Bar graphs (csgoprice3) and line graphs (csgoprice6) from matplot lib
and interpolated line graph values using SciPy lib

Csgoprice3 provides a static bar graph of pricings for current CSGO cases
Csgoprice6 stores the prices for cases each time it is run, interpolating the values between the times to show approximate price changes over time.
